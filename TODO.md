# TODO – High-Efficiency Synchronous Buck Converter

- [ ] Build LTspice model of 48V→12V synchronous buck topology
- [ ] Select SiC or fast-switching MOSFETs and drivers
- [ ] Sweep dead-time and switching frequency for peak efficiency
- [ ] Layout initial 2-layer PCB in KiCad (wide traces, low EMI)
- [ ] Simulate transient response for 0–5 A load steps
- [ ] Build + test with thermal camera + oscilloscope
