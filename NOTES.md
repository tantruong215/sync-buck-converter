# Development Notes – Synchronous Buck Converter

**June 6, 2025**  
Created repo and uploaded README. Built draft schematic in KiCad. Running initial simulations in LTspice to tune switching frequency and gate timings.

To Do Next:
- Sweep MOSFET parameters for efficiency
- Design 2-layer PCB stackup
- Simulate transient response for 0–5 A step
